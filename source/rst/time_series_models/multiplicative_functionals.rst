Overview
========

This lecture is a sequel to the :doc:`lecture on additive functionals <../time_series_models/additive_functionals>`

That lecture

#. defined a special class of **additive functionals** driven by a first-order vector VAR

#.  by taking the exponential of that additive functional, created an associated **multiplicative functional**

This lecture uses this special class to create and analyze two examples

* A  **log likelihood process**, an object at the foundation of both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to statistical inference

* A version of Robert E. Lucas's :cite:`lucas2003` and Thomas Tallarini's :cite:`Tall2000` approaches to measuring the benefits of moderating aggregate fluctuations

A Log-Likelihood Process
========================

Consider a vector of additive functionals :math:`\{y_t\}_{t=0}^\infty` described by

.. math::

    \begin{aligned}
        x_{t+1} & = A x_t + B z_{t+1}
        \\
        y_{t+1} - y_t & = D x_{t} + F z_{t+1},
    \end{aligned}

where :math:`A` is a stable matrix, :math:`\{z_{t+1}\}_{t=0}^\infty` is
an i.i.d. sequence of :math:`{\cal N}(0,I)` random vectors, :math:`F` is
nonsingular, and :math:`x_0` and :math:`y_0` are vectors of known
numbers

Evidently,

.. math::

    x_{t+1} = \left(A - B F^{-1}D \right)x_t
        + B F^{-1} \left(y_{t+1} - y_t \right),

so that :math:`x_{t+1}` can be constructed from observations on
:math:`\{y_{s}\}_{s=0}^{t+1}` and :math:`x_0`

The distribution of :math:`y_{t+1} - y_t` conditional on :math:`x_t` is normal with mean :math:`Dx_t` and nonsingular covariance matrix :math:`FF'`

Let :math:`\theta` denote the vector of free parameters of the model

These parameters pin down the elements of :math:`A, B, D, F`

The **log likelihood function** of :math:`\{y_s\}_{s=1}^t` is

.. math::

    \begin{aligned}
        \log L_{t}(\theta)  =
        & - {\frac 1 2} \sum_{j=1}^{t} (y_{j} - y_{j-1} -
             D x_{j-1})'(FF')^{-1}(y_{j} - y_{j-1} - D x_{j-1})
        \\
        & - {\frac t 2} \log \det (FF') - {\frac {k t} 2} \log( 2 \pi)
    \end{aligned}

Let's consider the case of a scalar process in which :math:`A, B, D, F` are scalars and :math:`z_{t+1}` is a scalar stochastic process

We let :math:`\theta_o` denote the "true" values of :math:`\theta`, meaning the values that generate the data

For the purposes of this exercise,  set :math:`\theta_o = (A, B, D, F) = (0.8, 1, 0.5, 0.2)`

Set :math:`x_0 = y_0 = 0`

Simulating sample paths
-----------------------

Let's write a program to simulate sample paths of :math:`\{ x_t, y_{t} \}_{t=0}^{\infty}`

We'll do this by formulating the additive functional as a linear state space model and putting the `LSS <https://github.com/QuantEcon/QuantEcon.jl/blob/master/src/lss.jl>`_ struct to work

Setup

    AMF_LSS_VAR = @with_kw (A, B, D, F = 0.0, ν = 0.0, lss = construct_ss(A, B, D, F, ν))

    function construct_ss(A, B, D, F, ν)
        H, g = additive_decomp(A, B, D, F)

        # Build A matrix for LSS
        # Order of states is: [1, t, xt, yt, mt]
        A1 = [1 0 0 0 0]       # Transition for 1

        A4 = [ν 0 D 1 0]       # Transition for y_{t+1}
        A5 = [0 0 0 0 1]       # Transition for m_{t+1}
        Abar = vcat(A1, A2, A3, A4, A5)

        # Build B matrix for LSS
        Bbar = [0, 0, B, F, H]

        # Build G matrix for LSS

        G2 = [0 0 0 1 0]               # Selector for y_{t}
        G3 = [0 0 0 0 1]               # Selector for martingale
        G4 = [0 0 -g 0 0]              # Selector for stationary
        G5 = [0 ν 0 0 0]               # Selector for trend
        Gbar = vcat(G1, G2, G3, G4, G5)

        # Build LSS struct
        x0 = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
        S0 = zeros(5, 5)
        return LSS(Abar, Bbar, Gbar, mu_0 = x0, Sigma_0 = S0)
    end

    function additive_decomp(A, B, D, F)
        A_res = 1 / (1 - A)
        g = D * A_res
        H = F + D * A_res * B

        return H, g
    end

    function multiplicative_decomp(A, B, D, F, ν)
        H, g = additive_decomp(A, B, D, F)
        ν_tilde = ν + 0.5 * H^2

        return ν_tilde, H, g
    end

    function loglikelihood_path(amf, x, y)
        @unpack A, B, D, F = amf
        T = length(y)
        FF = F^2
        FFinv = inv(FF)
        temp = y[2:end] - y[1:end-1] - D*x[1:end-1]
        obs =  temp .* FFinv .* temp
        obssum = cumsum(obs)
        scalar = (log(FF) + log(2pi)) * (1:T-1)
        return -0.5 * (obssum + scalar)
    end

    function loglikelihood(amf, x, y)
        llh = loglikelihood_path(amf, x, y)
        return llh[end]
    end

The heavy lifting is done inside the `AMF_LSS_VAR` struct

The following code adds some simple functions that make it straightforward to generate sample paths from an instance of `AMF_LSS_VAR`

.. code-block:: julia

    function simulate_xy(amf, T)
        foo, bar = simulate(amf.lss, T)
        x = bar[1, :]
        y = bar[2, :]
        return x, y
    end

    function simulate_paths(amf, T = 150, I = 5000)
        # Allocate space
        storeX = zeros(I, T)
        storeY = zeros(I, T)

        for i in 1:I
            # Do specific simulation
            x, y = simulate_xy(amf, T)

            # Fill in our storage matrices
            storeX[i, :] = x
            storeY[i, :] = y
        end

        return storeX, storeY
    end

    function population_means(amf, T = 150)
        # Allocate Space
        xmean = zeros(T)
        ymean = zeros(T)

        # Pull out moment generator
        moment_generator = moment_sequence(amf.lss)
        for (tt, x) = enumerate(moment_generator)
            ymeans = x[2]
            xmean[tt] = ymeans[1]
            ymean[tt] = ymeans[2]
            if tt == T
                break
            end
        end
        return xmean, ymean
    end

Now that we have these functions in our took kit, let's apply them to run some
simulations

In particular, let's use our program to generate :math:`I = 5000` sample paths of length :math:`T = 150`, labeled :math:`\{ x_{t}^i, y_{t}^i \}_{t=0}^\infty` for :math:`i = 1, ..., I`

Then we compute averages of :math:`\frac{1}{I} \sum_i x_t^i` and :math:`\frac{1}{I} \sum_i y_t^i` across the sample paths and compare them with the population means of :math:`x_t` and :math:`y_t`

Here goes

.. code-block:: julia
    :class: test

    Random.seed!(42);

.. code-block:: julia

    F = 0.2
    amf = AMF_LSS_VAR(A = 0.8, B = 1.0, D = 0.5, F = F)

    T = 150
    I = 5000

    # Simulate and compute sample means
    Xit, Yit = simulate_paths(amf, T, I)
    Xmean_t = mean(Xit, dims = 1)
    Ymean_t = mean(Yit, dims = 1)

    # Compute population means
    Xmean_pop, Ymean_pop = population_means(amf, T)

    # Plot sample means vs population means
    plt_1 = plot(Xmean_t', color = :blue, label = "1/I sum_i x_t^i")
    plot!(plt_1, Xmean_pop, color = :black, label = "E x_t")
    plot!(plt_1, title = "x_t", xlim = (0, T), legend = :bottomleft)

    plt_2 = plot(Ymean_t', color = :blue, label = "1/I sum_i x_t^i")
    plot!(plt_2, Ymean_pop, color = :black, label = "E y_t")
    plot!(plt_2, title = "y_t", xlim = (0, T), legend = :bottomleft)

    plot(plt_1, plt_2, layout = (2, 1), size = (800,500))

.. code-block:: julia
    :class: test

    @testset begin
        @test Xmean_t'[4] ≈ -0.012211946062314676 # These depend on the A, B, etc.
        @test Ymean_t'[100] ≈ -0.3351148038056963
    end

Simulating log-likelihoods
--------------------------

Our next aim is to write a program to simulate :math:`\{\log L_t \mid \theta_o\}_{t=1}^T`

We want as inputs to this program the *same* sample paths :math:`\{x_t^i, y_t^i\}_{t=0}^T` that we  have already computed

We now want to simulate :math:`I = 5000` paths of :math:`\{\log L_t^i  \mid \theta_o\}_{t=1}^T`

-  For each path, we compute :math:`\log L_T^i / T`

-  We also compute :math:`\frac{1}{I} \sum_{i=1}^I \log L_T^i / T`

Then we to compare these objects

Below we plot the histogram of :math:`\log L_T^i / T` for realizations :math:`i = 1, \ldots, 5000`

.. code-block:: julia
    :class: test

    Random.seed!(42);

.. code-block:: julia

    function simulate_likelihood(amf, Xit, Yit)
        # Get size
        I, T = size(Xit)

        # Allocate space
        LLit = zeros(I, T-1)

        for i in 1:I
            LLit[i, :] = loglikelihood_path(amf, Xit[i, :], Yit[i, :])
        end

        return LLit
    end

    # Get likelihood from each path x^{i}, Y^{i}
    LLit = simulate_likelihood(amf, Xit, Yit)

    LLT = 1 / T * LLit[:, end]
    LLmean_t = mean(LLT)

    plot(seriestype = :histogram, LLT, label = "")
    plot!(title = "Distribution of (I/T)log(L_T)|theta_0")
    vline!([LLmean_t], linestyle = :dash, color = :black, lw = 2, alpha = 0.6, label = "")

.. code-block:: julia
    :class: test

    @testset begin
        @test LLT[100] ≈ 0.237835678897198
        @test LLmean_t ≈ 0.18834771174533427
    end

Notice that the log likelihood is almost always nonnegative, implying that :math:`L_t` is typically bigger than 1

Recall that the likelihood function is a pdf (probability density function) and **not** a probability measure, so it can take values larger than 1

In the current case, the conditional variance of :math:`\Delta y_{t+1}`, which equals  :math:`FF^T=0.04`, is so small that the maximum value of the pdf is 2 (see the figure below)

This implies that approximately :math:`75\%` of the time (a bit more than one sigma deviation),  we should expect the **increment** of the log likelihood to be nonnegative

Let's see this in a simulation

.. code-block:: julia

    normdist = Normal(0, F)
    mult = 1.175
    println("The pdf at +/- $mult sigma takes the value: $(pdf(normdist,mult*F))")
    println("Probability of dL being larger than 1 is approx: "*
            "$(cdf(normdist,mult*F)-cdf(normdist,-mult*F))")

    # Compare this to the sample analogue:
    L_increment = LLit[:,2:end] - LLit[:,1:end-1]
    r,c = size(L_increment)
    frac_nonegative = sum(L_increment.>=0)/(c*r)
    print("Fraction of dlogL being nonnegative in the sample is: $(frac_nonegative)")

.. code-block:: julia
    :class: test

    @testset begin
        @test pdf(normdist, mult * F) ≈ 1.0001868966924388
        @test pdf(normdist, F) ≈ 1.2098536225957168
    end

Let's also plot the conditional pdf of :math:`\Delta y_{t+1}`

.. code-block:: julia

    xgrid = range(-1,  1, length = 100)
    println("The pdf at +/- one sigma takes the value: $(pdf(normdist, F)) ")
    plot(xgrid, pdf.(normdist, xgrid), label = "")
    plot!(title = "Conditional pdf f(Delta y_(t+1) | x_t)")

An alternative parameter vector
-------------------------------

Now consider alternative parameter vector :math:`\theta_1 = [A, B, D, F] = [0.9, 1.0, 0.55, 0.25]`

We want to compute :math:`\{\log L_t \mid \theta_1\}_{t=1}^T`

The :math:`x_t, y_t` inputs to this program should be exactly the **same** sample paths :math:`\{x_t^i, y_t^i\}_{t=0}^T` that we we computed above

This is because we want to generate data under the :math:`\theta_o` probability model but evaluate the likelihood under the :math:`\theta_1` model

So our task is to use our program to simulate :math:`I = 5000` paths of :math:`\{\log L_t^i  \mid \theta_1\}_{t=1}^T`

-  For each path, compute :math:`\frac{1}{T} \log L_T^i`

-  Then compute :math:`\frac{1}{I}\sum_{i=1}^I \frac{1}{T} \log L_T^i`

We want to compare these objects with each other and with the analogous objects that we computed above

Then we want to interpret outcomes

A function that we constructed can  handle these tasks

The only innovation is that we must create an alternative model to feed in

We will creatively call the new model ``amf2``

We make three graphs

* the first sets the stage by repeating an earlier graph

* the second contains two histograms of values of  log likelihoods of the two models  over the period :math:`T`

* the third compares likelihoods under the true and alternative models

Here's the code

.. code-block:: julia
    :class: test

    Random.seed!(42);

.. code-block:: julia

    # Create the second (wrong) alternative model
    amf2 = AMF_LSS_VAR(A = 0.9, B = 1.0, D = 0.55, F = 0.25) # parameters for θ_1 closer to θ_0

    # Get likelihood from each path x^{i}, y^{i}
    LLit2 = simulate_likelihood(amf2, Xit, Yit)

    LLT2 = 1/(T-1) * LLit2[:, end]
    LLmean_t2 = mean(LLT2)

    plot(seriestype = :histogram, LLT2, label = "")
    vline!([LLmean_t2], color = :black, lw = 2, linestyle = :dash, alpha = 0.6, label = "")
    plot!(title = "Distribution of (1/T)log(L_T) | theta_1)")

.. code-block:: julia
    :class: test

    @testset begin
        @test LLT2[1] ≈ 0.08791248248646343
        @test LLmean_t2 ≈ 0.09210776227743879
    end

Let's see a histogram of the log-likelihoods under the true and the alternative model (same sample paths)

.. code-block:: julia

    plot(seriestype = :histogram, LLT, bin = 50, alpha = 0.5, label = "True", normed = true)
    plot!(seriestype = :histogram, LLT2, bin = 50, alpha = 0.5, label = "Alternative",
          normed = true)
    vline!([mean(LLT)], color = :black, lw = 2, linestyle = :dash, label = "")
    vline!([mean(LLT2)], color = :black, lw = 2, linestyle = :dash, label = "")

Now we'll plot the histogram of the difference in log likelihood ratio

.. code-block:: julia

    LLT_diff = LLT - LLT2

    plot(seriestype = :histogram, LLT_diff, bin = 50, label = "")
    plot!(title = "(1/T)[log(L_T^i | theta_0) - log(L_T^i |theta_1)]")

Interpretation
--------------

These histograms of  log likelihood ratios illustrate  important features of **likelihood ratio tests** as tools for discriminating between statistical models

*  The loglikeklihood is higher on average under the true model -- obviously a very useful property

*  Nevertheless, for a positive fraction of realizations, the log likelihood is higher for the incorrect than for the true model

  * in these instances, a likelihood ratio test mistakenly selects the wrong model

* These mechanics underlie the statistical theory of **mistake probabilities** associated with model selection tests based on  likelihood ratio

(In a subsequent lecture, we'll use some of the code prepared in this lecture to illustrate mistake probabilities)

Benefits from Reduced Aggregate Fluctuations
============================================

Now let's turn to a new example of multiplicative functionals

This example illustrates  ideas in the literatures on

*  **long-run risk** in the consumption based asset pricing literature (e.g., :cite:`bansalyaron2004`, :cite:`hhl2008`, :cite:`hansen2007`)

*  **benefits of eliminating aggregate fluctuations** in representative agent macro models (e.g., :cite:`Tall2000`, :cite:`lucas2003`)

Let :math:`c_t` be consumption at date :math:`t \geq 0`

Suppose that :math:`\{\log c_t \}_{t=0}^\infty` is an additive functional described by

.. math::

    \log c_{t+1} - \log c_t = \nu + D \cdot x_t + F \cdot z_{t+1}

where

.. math::

    x_{t+1} = A x_t + B z_{t+1}

Here :math:`\{z_{t+1}\}_{t=0}^\infty` is an i.i.d. sequence of :math:`{\cal N}(0,I)` random vectors

A representative household ranks consumption processes :math:`\{c_t\}_{t=0}^\infty` with a utility functional :math:`\{V_t\}_{t=0}^\infty` that satisfies

.. math::
    :label: old1mf

    \log V_t - \log c_t = U \cdot x_t + {\sf u}

where

.. math::

    U = \exp(-\delta) \left[ I - \exp(-\delta) A' \right]^{-1} D

and

.. math::

    {\sf u}
      = {\frac {\exp( -\delta)}{ 1 - \exp(-\delta)}} {\nu} + \frac{(1 - \gamma)}{2} {\frac {\exp(-\delta)}{1 - \exp(-\delta)}}
    \biggl| D' \left[ I - \exp(-\delta) A \right]^{-1}B + F \biggl|^2,

Here :math:`\gamma \geq 1` is a risk-aversion coefficient and :math:`\delta > 0` is a rate of time preference

Consumption as a multiplicative process
---------------------------------------

We begin by showing that consumption is a **multiplicative functional** with representation

.. math::
    :label: old2mf

    \frac{c_t}{c_0}
    = \exp(\tilde{\nu}t )
    \left( \frac{\tilde{M}_t}{\tilde{M}_0} \right)
    \left( \frac{\tilde{e}(x_0)}{\tilde{e}(x_t)} \right)

where :math:`\left( \frac{\tilde{M}_t}{\tilde{M}_0} \right)` is a likelihood ratio process and :math:`\tilde M_0 = 1`

At this point, as an exercise, we ask the reader please to verify the follow formulas for :math:`\tilde{\nu}` and :math:`\tilde{e}(x_t)` as functions of :math:`A, B, D, F`:

.. math::

    \tilde \nu =  \nu + \frac{H \cdot H}{2}

and

.. math::

    \tilde e(x) = \exp[g(x)] = \exp \bigl[ D' (I - A)^{-1} x \bigr]

Simulating a likelihood ratio process again
-------------------------------------------

Next, we want a program to simulate the likelihood ratio process :math:`\{ \tilde{M}_t \}_{t=0}^\infty`

In particular, we want to simulate 5000 sample paths of length :math:`T=1000` for the case in which :math:`x` is a scalar and :math:`[A, B, D, F] = [0.8, 0.001, 1.0, 0.01]` and :math:`\nu = 0.005`

After accomplishing this, we want to display a histogram of :math:`\tilde{M}_T^i` for
:math:`T=1000`

Here is code that accomplishes these tasks

.. code-block:: julia
    :class: test

    Random.seed!(42);

.. code-block:: julia

    function simulate_martingale_components(amf, T = 1_000, I = 5_000)
        # Get the multiplicative decomposition
        @unpack A, B, D, F, ν, lss = amf
        ν, H, g = multiplicative_decomp(A, B, D, F, ν)

        # Allocate space
        add_mart_comp = zeros(I, T)

        # Simulate and pull out additive martingale component
        for i in 1:I
            foo, bar = simulate(lss, T)
            # Martingale component is third component
            add_mart_comp[i, :] = bar[3, :]
        end

        mul_mart_comp = exp.(add_mart_comp' .- (0:T-1) * H^2 / 2)'

        return add_mart_comp, mul_mart_comp
    end

    # Build model
    amf_2 = AMF_LSS_VAR(A = 0.8, B = 0.001, D = 1.0, F = 0.01, ν = 0.005)

    amc, mmc = simulate_martingale_components(amf_2, 1_000, 5_000)

    amcT = amc[:, end]
    mmcT = mmc[:, end]

    println("The (min, mean, max) of additive Martingale component in period T is")
    println("\t ($(minimum(amcT)), $(mean(amcT)), $(maximum(amcT)))")

    println("The (min, mean, max) of multiplicative Martingale component in period T is")
    println("\t ($(minimum(mmcT)), $(mean(mmcT)), $(maximum(mmcT)))")

.. code-block:: julia

-  The preceding min, mean, and max of the cross-section of the date
   :math:`T` realizations of the multiplicative martingale component of
   :math:`c_t` indicate that the sample mean is close to its population
   mean of 1

    * This outcome prevails for all values of the horizon :math:`T`

-  The cross-section distribution of the multiplicative martingale
   component of :math:`c` at date :math:`T` approximates a log normal
   distribution well

-  The histogram of the additive martingale component of
   :math:`\log c_t` at date :math:`T` approximates a normal distribution
   well

Here's a histogram of the additive martingale component

.. code-block:: julia

    plot(seriestype = :histogram, amcT, bin = 25, normed = true, label = "")
    plot!(title = "Histogram of Additive Martingale Component")

Here's a histogram of the multiplicative martingale component

.. code-block:: julia

    plot(seriestype = :histogram, mmcT, bin = 25, normed = true, label = "")
    plot!(title = "Histogram of Multiplicative Martingale Component")

Representing the likelihood ratio process
-----------------------------------------

The likelihood ratio process :math:`\{\widetilde M_t\}_{t=0}^\infty` can be represented as

.. math::

    \widetilde M_t = \exp \biggl( \sum_{j=1}^t \biggl(H \cdot z_j -\frac{ H \cdot H }{2} \biggr) \biggr),  \quad \widetilde M_0 =1 ,

where :math:`H =  [F + B'(I-A')^{-1} D]`

It follows that :math:`\log {\widetilde M}_t \sim {\mathcal N} ( -\frac{t H \cdot H}{2}, t H \cdot H )` and that consequently :math:`{\widetilde M}_t` is log normal

Let's plot the probability density functions for :math:`\log {\widetilde M}_t` for
:math:`t=100, 500, 1000, 10000, 100000`

Then let's use the plots to  investigate how these densities evolve through time

We will plot the densities of :math:`\log {\widetilde M}_t` for different values of :math:`t`

Here is some code that tackles these tasks

.. code-block:: julia

    function Mtilde_t_density(amf, t; xmin = 1e-8, xmax = 5.0, npts = 5000)

        # Pull out the multiplicative decomposition
        νtilde, H, g =
            multiplicative_decomp(amf.A, amf.B, amf.D, amf.F, amf.ν)
        H2 = H*H

        # The distribution
        mdist = LogNormal(-t * H2 / 2, sqrt(t * H2))
        x = range(xmin,  xmax, length = npts)
        p = pdf.(mdist, x)

        return x, p
    end

    function logMtilde_t_density(amf, t; xmin = -15.0, xmax = 15.0, npts = 5000)

        # Pull out the multiplicative decomposition
        @unpack A, B, D, F, ν = amf
        νtilde, H, g = multiplicative_decomp(A, B, D, F, ν)
        H2 = H * H

        # The distribution
        lmdist = Normal(-t * H2 / 2, sqrt(t * H2))
        x = range(xmin,  xmax, length = npts)
        p = pdf.(lmdist, x)

        return x, p
    end

    times_to_plot = [10, 100, 500, 1000, 2500, 5000]
    dens_to_plot = [Mtilde_t_density(amf_2, t, xmin=1e-8, xmax=6.0) for t in times_to_plot]
    ldens_to_plot = [logMtilde_t_density(amf_2, t, xmin=-10.0, xmax=10.0) for t in times_to_plot]

    # plot_title = "Densities of M_t^tilda" is required, however, plot_title is not yet
    # supported in Plots
    plots = plot(layout = (3,2), size = (600,800))

    for (it, dens_t) in enumerate(dens_to_plot)
        x, pdf = dens_t
        plot!(plots[it], title = "Density for time (time_to_plot[it])")
        plot!(plots[it], pdf, fillrange = [[0], pdf], label = "")
    end
    plot(plots)

These probability density functions illustrate a **peculiar property** of log likelihood ratio processes:

* With respect to the true model probabilities, they have mathematical expectations equal to :math:`1` for all :math:`t \geq 0`

* They almost surely converge to zero

Welfare benefits of reduced random aggregate fluctuations
---------------------------------------------------------

Suppose in the tradition of a strand of macroeconomics (for example Tallarini :cite:`Tall2000`, :cite:`lucas2003`) we want to estimate the welfare benefits from removing random fluctuations around trend growth

We shall  compute how much initial consumption :math:`c_0` a representative consumer who ranks consumption streams according to :eq:`old1mf` would be willing to sacrifice to enjoy the consumption stream

.. math::

    \frac{c_t}{c_0} = \exp (\tilde{\nu} t)

rather than the stream described by equation :eq:`old2mf`

We want to compute the implied percentage reduction in :math:`c_0` that the representative consumer would accept

To accomplish this, we write a function that computes the coefficients :math:`U`
and :math:`u` for the original values of :math:`A, B, D, F, \nu`, but
also for the case that  :math:`A, B, D, F = [0, 0, 0, 0]` and
:math:`\nu = \tilde{\nu}`

Here's our code

.. code-block:: julia

    function Uu(amf, δ, γ)
        @unpack A, B, D, F, ν = amf
        ν_tilde, H, g = multiplicative_decomp(A, B, D, F, ν)

        resolv = 1 / (1 - exp(-δ) * A)
        vect = F + D * resolv * B

        U_risky = exp(-δ) * resolv * D
        u_risky = exp(-δ) / (1 - exp(-δ)) * (ν + 0.5 * (1 - γ) * (vect^2))

        U_det = 0
        u_det = exp(-δ) / (1 - exp(-δ))  * ν_tilde

        return U_risky, u_risky, U_det, u_det
    end

    # Set remaining parameters
    δ = 0.02
    γ = 2.0

    # Get coeffs
    U_r, u_r, U_d, u_d = Uu(amf_2, δ, γ)

The values of the two processes are

.. math::

    \begin{aligned}
        \log V^r_0 &= \log c^r_0 + U^r x_0 + u^r
         \\
        \log V^d_0 &= \log c^d_0 + U^d x_0 + u^d
    \end{aligned}

We look for the ratio :math:`\frac{c^r_0-c^d_0}{c^r_0}` that makes
:math:`\log V^r_0 - \log V^d_0 = 0`

.. math::

    \begin{aligned}
        \underbrace{ \log V^r_0 - \log V^d_0}_{=0} + \log c^d_0 - \log c^r_0
          &= (U^r-U^d) x_0 + u^r - u^d
        \\
     \frac{c^d_0}{ c^r_0}
         &= \exp\left((U^r-U^d) x_0 + u^r - u^d\right)
    \end{aligned}

Hence, the implied percentage reduction in :math:`c_0` that the
representative consumer would accept is given by

.. math::

    \frac{c^r_0-c^d_0}{c^r_0} = 1 - \exp\left((U^r-U^d) x_0 + u^r - u^d\right)

Let's compute this

.. code-block:: julia

    x0 = 0.0  # initial conditions
    logVC_r = U_r * x0 + u_r
    logVC_d = U_d * x0 + u_d

    perc_reduct = 100 * (1 - exp(logVC_r - logVC_d))
    perc_reduct

.. code-block:: julia
    :class: test

    @test perc_reduct ≈ 1.0809878812017448

We find that the consumer would be willing to take a percentage reduction of initial consumption equal to around 1.081
