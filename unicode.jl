# Goal of this file is to test unicode support across platforms we'll be using (Atom, Terminal, Jupyter) and across OSs.

# Glyphs
    L̃ = 2.0 # L-tilde
    u₀ = 3.0 # u-naught
    â = 4.0 # a-hat
    z̲ = 5.0 # z-underbar

# Ordinary unicode characters
    println("π, α, ζ, ξ, δ, ρ, γ, β, χ, ω, θ, υ, ν, Γ, Δ")

# Combining.
    "γ̃" # gamma-tilde
    "α̂" # alpha-hat
    "π̲" # pi-underbar
