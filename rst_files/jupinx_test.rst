List Case 
===========

1. Here's a list 

    * Here's a sublist 

    * Another one 



Lists and Code 
------------------------

1. Here's a list point 

.. code-block:: julia 

    foo = n -> (x -> x + n) # some code 

2. The list will resume nummbering at "1", but should be "2" 

All Three 
---------------

1. foo

2. Run bar 

    * Except when using Windows, when you run 

.. code-block:: julia 

    # foobar 

3. Run some more code...

Equation Hyperlinks
-------------------------

Say we have an equation 


.. math::
    :label: fixed_point_map_test

    v = f(v)

And want to link to it in text :eq:`fixed_point_map_test`
