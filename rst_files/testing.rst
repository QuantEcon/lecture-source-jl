This lecture is about structuring your project as a Julia module, and testing it with tools from GitHub

Benefits include

* Specifying dependencies (and their versions), so that your project works across Julia setups and over time

* Being able to load your project's functions from outside without copy/pasting

* Writing tests that run locally, *and automatically on the GitHub server*

* Having GitHub test your project across operating systems, Julia versions, etc.

.. _project_setup:

Project Setup
=======================

Account Setup
--------------------

Travis CI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As we'll see later, Travis is a service that automatically tests your project on the GitHub server

First, we need to make sure that your GitHub account is set up with Travis CI and CodeCov

As a reminder, make sure you signed up for the GitHub `Student Developer Pack <https://education.github.com/pack/>`_ or `Academic Plan <https://help.github.com/articles/applying-for-an-academic-research-discount/>_` if eligible

Navigate to the `travis-ci.com website <https://travis-ci.com/>`_ and click "sign up with GitHub." Supply your credentials

If you get stuck, see the `Travis tutorial <https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/tutorial/>`_

CodeCov
^^^^^^^^^

CodeCov is a service that tells you how expansive your tests are (i.e., how much of your code is untested)

To sign up, visit the `CodeCov website <http://codecov.io/>`_, and click "sign up"

.. figure:: /_static/figures/codecov-1.png
    :scale: 60%

Next, click "add a repository" and *enable private scope* (this allows CodeCov to service your private projects)

The result should be

.. figure:: /_static/figures/codecov-2.png
    :scale: 60%

This is all we need for now

Julia Setup
--------------------

.. literalinclude:: /_static/includes/alldeps.jl

1. Load the `PkgTemplates <https://github.com/invenia/PkgTemplates.jl/>`_ package

    .. code-block:: julia

        using PkgTemplates

2. Create a *template* for your project

This specifies metadata like the license we'll be using (MIT by default), the location (``~/.julia/dev`` by default), etc.

.. code-block:: julia

    ourTemplate = Template(;user="quanteconuser", plugins = [TravisCI(), CodeCov()])

3. Create a specific project based off this template

    .. code-block:: julia

        generate("ExamplePackage.jl", ourTemplate)

If we navigate to the package directory (shown in the output), we should see something like

.. figure:: /_static/figures/testing-dir.png
    :scale: 60%

Adding Project to Git
------------------------

The next step is to add this project to Git version control

First, open the repository screen in your account as discussed previously

We'll want the following settings

.. figure:: /_static/figures/testing-git1.png
    :scale: 60%

In particular

* The repo you create should have the same name as the project we added

* We should leave the boxes unchecked for the ``README.md``, ``LICENSE``, and ``.gitignore``, since these are handled by ``PkgTemplates``

Then, drag and drop your folder from your ``~/.julia/dev`` directory to GitHub Desktop

Click the "publish branch" button to upload your files to GitHub

If you navigate to your git repo (ours is `here <https:https://github.com/quanteconuser/ExamplePackage.jl/>`_), you should see something like

.. figure:: /_static/figures/testing-git2.png
    :scale: 60%

Adding Project to Julia Package Manager
-------------------------------------------

We also want Julia's package manager to be aware of the project

First, open a REPL in the newly created project directory, either by noting the path printed above, or by running

.. code-block:: julia

    DEPOT_PATH

And navigating to the first element, then the subdirectory ``/dev/ExamplePackage``

Note the lack of ``.jl``!

You can change the path of a Julia REPL by running

.. code-block:: julia

    cd(joinpath(DEPOT_PATH[1], "dev", "ExamplePackage"))

Then, run

.. code-block:: julia

    ] activate

To get into the main Julia environment, and

.. code-block:: julia

    ] dev .

We see the change reflected in our default package list

.. code-block:: julia

    ] st

Using the Package Manager
--------------------------------

Now, from any Julia terminal in the future, we can run

.. code-block:: none

    using ExamplePackage

To use its exported functions

We can also get the path to this by running

.. code-block:: none

    using ExamplePackage
    pathof(ExamplePackage) # returns path to src/ExamplePackage.jl

Project Structure
==========================

Let's unpack the structure of the generated project

* The first directory, ``.git``, holds the version control information

* The ``src`` directory contains the project's source code. Currently, it should contain only one file (``ExamplePackage.jl``), which reads

.. code-block:: none

    module ExamplePackage

    greet() = print("Hello World!")

    end # module

* Likewise, the ``test`` directory should have only one file (``runtests.jl``), which reads:

.. code-block:: none

    using ExamplePackage
    using Test

    @testset "ExamplePackage.jl" begin
        # Write your own tests here.
    end

In particular, the workflow is to export objects we want to test (``using ExamplePackage``), and test them using Julia's ``Test`` module

The other important text files for now are

* ``Project.toml`` and ``Manifest.toml``, which contain dependency information

* The ``.gitignore`` file (which may display as an untitled file), which contains files and paths for ``git`` to ignore

Project Workflow
=========================

Dependency Management
----------------------------

Environments
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As before, the TOML files define an *environment* for our project

Any package operations we execute will be reflected in our ``ExamplePackage.jl`` directory's TOML

Likewise, the only packages Julia knows about are those in the ``ExamplePackage.jl`` TOML. For example

.. code-block:: julia

    ] activate ExamplePackage

.. code-block:: julia

    using QuantEcon # fails, even though QuantEcon is on the machine

This allows us to share the project with others, who can exactly reproduce the state used to build and test it

See the `Pkg3 docs <https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Pkg/>`_ for more information

Pkg Operations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For now, let's just try adding a dependency

.. code-block:: julia

    ] add Expectations

We can track changes in the TOML, as before

Here's the Manifest

.. figure:: /_static/figures/testing-atom-manifest.png
    :scale: 60%

We can also run other operations, like ``] up``, ``] precompile``, etc.

Recall that, to quit the active environment and return to the base ``(v1.0)``, simply run

.. code-block:: julia

    ] activate

Without any arguments

Writing Code
-----------------

The basic idea is to work in ``tests/runtests.jl``, while reproducible functions should go in the ``src/ExamplePackage.jl``

For example, let's say we add ``Distributions.jl``

.. code-block:: julia

    ] activate ExamplePackage

.. code-block:: julia

    ] add Distributions

and edit the source to read as follows::

    module ExamplePackage

    greet() = print("Hello World!")

    using Expectations, Distributions

    function foo(μ = 1., σ = 2.)
        d = Normal(μ, σ)
        E = expectation(d)
        return E(x -> sin(x))
    end

    export foo

    end # module

Let's try calling this from the top environment (to stand in for a fresh REPL)

.. code-block:: julia

    ] activate

.. code-block:: julia

    using ExamplePackage
    ExamplePackage.greet()

.. code-block:: julia

    foo() # exported, so don't need to qualify the namespace

Jupyter Workflow
------------------------

We can also call this function from a Jupyter notebook

Let's create a new output directory in our project, and run ``jupyter lab`` from it. Call a new notebook ``output.ipynb``

.. figure:: /_static/figures/testing-output.png
    :scale: 60%

From here, we can use our package's functions in the usual way

This lets us produce neat output documents, without pasting the whole codebase

We can also edit it interactively inside the notebook

.. figure:: /_static/figures/testing-notebook.png
    :scale: 60%

The change will be reflected in the ``Project.toml`` file::

    name = "ExamplePackage"
    uuid = "f85830d0-e1f0-11e8-2fad-8762162ab251"
    authors = ["QuantEcon User <quanteconuser@gmail.com>"]
    version = "0.1.0"

    [deps]
    Distributions = "31c24e10-a181-5473-b8eb-7969acd0382f"
    Expectations = "2fe49d83-0758-5602-8f54-1f90ad0d522b"
    Parameters = "d96e819e-fc66-5662-9728-84c9c7592b0a"

    [extras]
    Test = "8dfed614-e22c-5e08-85e1-65c5234f0b40"

    [targets]
    test = ["Test"]

And the Manifest as well

Be sure to add ``output/.ipynb_checkpoints`` to your ``.gitignore`` file, so that's not checked in

Make sure you've activated the project environment (``] activate ExamplePackage``) before you try to propagate changes

Collaborative Work
--------------------------

For someone else to get the package, they simply need to

1. Run the following command

.. code-block:: julia

    ] dev https://github.com/quanteconuser/ExamplePackage.jl.git

This will place the repository inside their ``~/.julia/dev`` folder

2. Drag-and-drop the folder to GitHub desktop in the usual way

Recall that the path to your ``~/.julia`` folder is

.. code-block:: julia

    ] DEPOT_PATH[1]

They can then collaborate as they would on other git repositories

In particular, they can run

.. code-block:: julia

    ] activate ExamplePackage

.. code-block:: julia

    ] instantiate

To make sure the right dependencies are installed on their machine

Unit Testing
====================================

It's important to make sure that your code is well-tested

There are a few different kinds of test, each with different purposes

* *Unit testing* makes sure that individual pieces of a project function as expected

* *Integration testing* makes sure that they work together as expected

* *Regression testing* makes sure that behavior is unchanged over time

In this lecture, we'll focus on unit testing


The ``Test`` Module
-------------------------

Julia provides testing features through a built-in package called ``Test``, which we get by ``using Test``

The basic object is the macro ``@test``

.. code-block:: julia

    using Test
    @test 1 == 1
    @test 1 ≈ 1

Tests will pass if the condition is ``true``, or fail otherwise

If a test is failing, we should *flag it and move on*

.. code-block:: julia

    @test_broken 1 == 2

This way, we still have access to information about the test, instead of just deleting it or commenting it out

There are other test macros, that check for things like error handling and type-stability. Advanced users can check the `Julia docs <https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Test/>`_

Example
-----------

Let's add some unit tests for the ``foo()`` function we defined earlier. Our ``tests/runtests.jl`` file should look like this

.. code-block:: julia

    using ExamplePackage
    using Test

    @test foo() == 0.11388071406436832
    @test foo(1, 1.5) == 0.2731856314283442
    @test_broken foo(1, 0) # tells us this is broken

And run it by running

.. code-block:: julia

    ] test

from an activated REPL

Test Sets
-------------

By default, the ``runtests.jl`` folder starts off with a ``@testset``

This is useful for organizing different batches of tests, but for now we can simply ignore it

To learn more about test sets, see `the docs <https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Test/index.html#Working-with-Test-Sets-1/>`_

Running Tests Locally
-----------------------

There are a few different ways to run the tests for your package

* From a fresh REPL, run ``pkg> test ExamplePackage``

* From an activated REPL, simply run ``pkg> test`` (recall that you can activate with ``pkg> activate ExamplePackage``)

* Hit shift-enter in Atom on the actual ``runtests.jl`` file (as below). Recall that we can get the path of the package by running ``using ExamplePackage; pathof(ExamplePackage)`` from an unactivated REPL


Continuous Integration with Travis
==========================================

Setup
-------

By default, Travis should have access to all your repositories and deploy automatically

This includes private repos if you're on a student developer pack or an academic plan (Travis detects this automatically)

To change this, go to "settings" under your GitHub profile

.. figure:: /_static/figures/git-settings.png
    :scale: 60%

Click "Applications," then "Travis CI," then "Configure," and choose the repos you want to be tracked

Build Options
----------------

By default, Travis will compile and test your project (i.e., "build" it) for new commits and PRs for every tracked repo with a ``.travis.yml`` file

We can see ours by opening it in Atom

.. code-block:: julia

    # Documentation: http://docs.travis-ci.com/user/languages/julia/
    language: julia
    os:
    - linux
    - osx
    julia:
    - 1.0
    - nightly
    matrix:
    allow_failures:
        - julia: nightly
    fast_finish: true
    notifications:
    email: false
    after_success:
    - julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add("Coverage"); using Coverage; Codecov.submit(process_folder())'

This is telling Travis to build the project in Julia, on OSX and Linux, using Julia v1.0 and the latest ("nightly")

It also says that if the nightly version doesn't work, that shouldn't register as a failure

**Note** You won't need OSX unless you're building something Mac-specific, like iOS or Swift. You can delete those lines to speed up the build. Likewise the nightly Julia

Working with Builds
--------------------

As above, builds are triggered whenever we push changes or open a pull request

For example, if we push our changes to the server and then click the Travis badge on the README, we should see something like

.. figure:: /_static/figures/travis-progress.png
    :scale: 60%

This gives us an overview of all the builds running for that commit

To inspect a build more closely (say, if it fails), we can click on it and expand the log options

.. figure:: /_static/figures/travis-log.png
    :scale: 60%

Note that the build times here aren't informative, because we can't generally control the hardware to which our job is allocated

We can also cancel specific jobs, either from their specific pages or by clicking the grey "x" button on the dashboard

Lastly, we can trigger builds manually (without a new commit or PR) from the Travis overview

.. figure:: /_static/figures/travis-trigger.png
    :scale: 60%

To commit *without* triggering a build, simply add [ci skip] somewhere inside the commit message

Travis and Pull Requests
----------------------------

One key feature of Travis is the ability to see at-a-glance whether PRs pass tests before merging them

This happens automatically when Travis is enabled on a repository

For an example of this feature, see `this PR <https://github.com/QuantEcon/Games.jl/pull/65/>`_ in the Games.jl repository

CodeCoverage
===================

Beyond the success or failure of our test suite, we also want to know how much of our code the tests cover

The tool we use to do this is called `CodeCov <http://codecov.io>`_

Setup
---------

You'll find that codecov is automatically enabled for public repos with Travis

For private ones, you'll need to first get an access token

Add private scope in the CodeCov website, just like we did for Travis

Navigate to the repo settings page (i.e., ``https://codecov.io/gh/quanteconuser/ExamplePackage.jl/settings`` for our repo) and copy the token

Next, go to your travis settings and add an environment variable as below

.. figure:: /_static/figures/travis-settings.png
    :scale: 60%

Interpreting Results
------------------------

Click the CodeCov badge to see the build page for your project

This shows us that our tests cover 50 \% of our functions in ``src//``

To get a more granular view, we can click the ``src//`` and the resultant filename

.. figure:: /_static/figures/codecov.png
    :scale: 60%

This shows us precisely which methods (and parts of methods) are untested

Pull Requests to External Julia Projects
===============================================

As mentioned in `version control <version_control>`_, sometimes we'll want to work on external repos that are also Julia projects

The first thing is to ``] dev`` the git URL (or package name, if the project is a registered Julia package), which will both clone the git repo and sync it with the Julia package manager

For example, running

.. code-block:: julia
    :class: no-execute

    ] dev Expectations

will clone the repo ``https://github.com/quantecon/Expectations.jl`` to ``~/.julia/dev``

Make sure you do this from a fresh REPL

As a reminder, you can find the location of your ``~/.julia`` folder (called the "user depot"), by running

.. code-block:: julia

    DEPOT_PATH[1]

The ``] dev`` command will also add the target to the package manager, so that whenever we run ``using Expectations``, Julia will load our cloned copy from that location

.. code-block:: julia
    :class: no-execute

    using Expectations
    pathof(Expectations) # points to our git clone

Next, drag that folder to GitHub Desktop

The next step is to fork the original (external) package from its website (i.e., ``https://github.com/quantecon/Expectations.jl``) to your account (``https://github.com/quanteconuser/Expectations.jl`` in our case)

.. figure:: /_static/figures/testing-fork.png
    :scale: 60%

Lastly, edit the settings in GitHub Desktop (from the "Repository" dropdown) to reflect the new URL

.. figure:: /_static/figures/testing-repo-settings.png
    :scale: 60%

Here, we'd change the highlighted text to read ``quanteconuser``, or whatever our GitHub ID is

If you make some changes in a text editor and return to GitHub Desktop, you'll see something like

.. figure:: /_static/figures/testing-commit.png
    :scale: 60%

Here, for example, we're revising the README

Clicking "commit to master" (recall that the checkboxes next to each file indicate whether it's to be committed) and then pushing (e.g., hitting "push" under the "Repository" dropdown) will add the committed changes to your account

To confirm this, we can check the history on our account `here <https://github.com/quanteconuser/Expectations.jl/commits/master>`_; for more on working with git repositories, see the `version control <version_control>`_ lecture

.. figure:: /_static/figures/testing-expectations.png
    :scale: 60%

The green check mark indicates that Travis tests passed for this commit

Clicking "new pull request" from the pull requests tab will show us a snapshot of the changes, and let us create a pull request for project maintainers to review and approve

.. figure:: /_static/figures/testing-pr2.png
    :scale: 60%

For more on PRs, see the relevant section of the `version control <version_control>`_ lecture

Case with Write Access
---------------------------

If you have write access to the repo, we can skip the preceding steps about forking and changing the URL

You can use ``] dev`` on a package name or the URL of the package.

.. code-block:: julia
    :class: no-execute

    ] dev Expectations

or ``] dev https://github.com/quanteconuser/Expectations.jl.git`` as an example for an unreleased package by URL

Which will again clone the repo to ``~/.julia/dev``, and use it as a Julia package

.. code-block:: julia
    :class: no-execute

    using Expectations
    pathof(Expectations) # points to our git clone

Next, drag that folder to GitHub Desktop

Then, in order to work with a project locally, all we need to do is open it in a text editor (like Atom)

.. figure:: /_static/figures/testing-atom-package.png
    :scale: 60%

From here, we can edit this package just like we created it ourselves and use GitHub Desktop to track versions of our package files (say, after ``] up``, or editing source code, ``] add Package``, etc.)

Removing a Julia Package
------------------------------

To "un-dev" a Julia package (say, if we want to use our old ``Expectations.jl``), you can simply run

.. code-block:: julia
    :class: no-execute

    ] free Expectations

To delete it entirely, simply run

.. code-block:: julia
    :class: no-execute

    ] rm Expectations

Both from a fresh REPL

Benchmarking
==================

Another goal of testing is to make sure that code doesn't slow down significantly from one version to the next

We can do this using tools provided by the ``BenchmarkTools.jl`` package

See the ``need for speed`` lecture for more details

Additional Notes
=======================

* The `JuliaCI <https://github.com/JuliaCI/>`_ organization provides more Julia utilities for continuous integration and testing

* This `Salesforce document <https://developer.salesforce.com/page/How_to_Write_Good_Unit_Tests/>`_ has some good lessons about writing and testing code

Exercises
============

Exercise 1
---------------

Following the `instructions for a new project <project_setup>`_, create a new package on your github account called ``NewtonsMethod.jl``

In this package, you should create a simple package to do Newton's Method using the code you did in the
`Newton's method <jbe_ex8a>`_ exercise in `Julia by example <julia_by_example>`_

In particular, within your package you should have two functions

* ``newtonroot(f, f′; x₀, tol = 1E-7, maxiter = 1000)``
* ``newtonroot(f; x₀, tol = 1E-7, maxiter = 1000)``

Where the second function uses Automatic Differentiation to call the first.

The package should include

* implementations of those functions in the ``/src`` directory
* comprehensive set of tests
* project and manifest files to replicate your development environment
* automated running of the tests with Travis CI in GitHub

For the tests, you should have at the very minimum

* a way to handle non-convergence (e.g. return back ``nothing`` as discussed in `error handling <error_handling>`_
* several ``@test`` for the root of a known function, given the ``f`` and analytical ``f'`` derivatives
* tests of those roots using the automatic differentiation version of the function
* test of finding those roots with a ``BigFloat`` and not just a ``Float64``
* test of non-convergence for a function without a root (e.g. :math:`f(x) = 2 + x^2` )
* test to ensure that the ``maxiter`` is working (e.g. what happens if you call ``maxiter = 5``
* test to ensure that ``tol`` is working

And anything else you can think of.  You should be able to run ``] test`` for the project to check that the test-suite is running, and then ensure that it is running automatically on Travis CI

Push a commit to the repository which breaks one of the tests and see what the Travis CI reports after running the build
