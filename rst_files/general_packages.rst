Overview 
============


.. I am not sure I agree... The size of the ecosystem depends on what kind of package you are thinking of
.. While Julia lacks the massive scientific ecosystem of Python, it has successfully attracted a small army of enthusiastic and talented developers

Julia has both a large number of useful, well written libraries and many incomplete poorly maintained proofs of concept

A major advantage of Julia libraries is that, because Julia itself is sufficiently fast, there is less need to mix in low level languages like C and Fortran

As a result, most Julia libraries are written exclusively in Julia

Not only does this make the libraries more portable, it makes them much easier to dive into, read, learn from and modify

In this lecture we introduce a few of the Julia libraries that we've found particularly useful for quantitative work in economics

Also see :doc:`data and statistical packages <data_statistical_packages>` and :doc:`optimization, solver, and related packages <optimization_solver_packages>` for more domain specific packages

Setup
------------------

.. literalinclude:: /_static/includes/alldeps_no_using.jl

.. code-block:: julia 
    :class: hide-output 

    using LinearAlgebra, Statistics, Compat 
    using QuantEcon, QuadGK, FastGaussQuadrature, Distributions, Expectations
    using Interpolations, Plots, LaTeXStrings, ProgressMeter

.. We have seen more detail on this package than this, so probably best to rewrite
.. Distributions
.. =====================
.. 
.. Functions for manipulating probability distributions and generating random
.. variables are supplied by the excellent `Distributions.jl <https://github.com/JuliaStats/Distributions.jl>`_ package
.. 
.. We'll restrict ourselves to a few simple examples (the package itself has `detailed documentation <https://juliastats.github.io/Distributions.jl/latest/index.html>`_)
.. 
.. * ``d = Normal(m, s)`` creates a normal distribution with mean :math:`m` and standard deviation :math:`s`
.. 
..     * defaults are ``m = 0`` and ``s = 1``
.. 
.. * ``d = Uniform(a, b)`` creates a uniform distribution on interval :math:`[a, b]`
.. 
..     * defaults are ``a = 0`` and ``b = 1``
.. 
.. * ``d = Binomial(n, p)`` creates a binomial over :math:`n` trials with success probability :math:`p`
.. 
.. * defaults are ``n = 1`` and ``p = 0.5``
.. 
.. Distributions.jl defines various methods for acting on these instances in order to obtain
.. 
.. * random draws
.. 
.. * evaluations of pdfs (densities), cdfs (distribution functions), quantiles, etc.
.. 
.. * mean, variance, kurtosis, etc.
.. 
.. For example,
.. 
.. * To generate ``k`` draws from the instance ``d`` use ``rand(d, k)``
.. 
.. * To obtain the mean of the distribution use ``mean(d)``
.. 
.. * To evaluate the probability density function of ``d`` at ``x`` use ``pdf(d, x)``
.. 
.. Further details on the interface can be found `here <https://juliastats.github.io/Distributions.jl/latest/univariate.html#Common-Interface-1>`__
.. 
.. Several multivariate distributions are also implemented


Numerical Integration
=============================

Many applications require directly calculating a numerical derivative and calculating expectations

Adaptive Quadrature
---------------------

A high accuracy solution for calculating numerical integrals is `QuadGK <https://github.com/JuliaMath/QuadGK.jl>`_ 
 
.. code-block:: julia
 
     using QuadGK
     @show value, tol = quadgk(cos, -2π, 2π);
 
 
This is an adaptive Gauss-Kronrod integration technique that's relatively accurate for smooth functions

However, its adaptive implementation makes it slow and not well suited to inner loops

Gaussian Quadrature
----------------------

Alternatively, many integrals can be done efficiently with (non-adaptive) `Gaussian quadrature <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_quadrature>`_

For example, using `FastGaussQuadrature.jl <https://github.com/ajt60gaibb/FastGaussQuadrature.jl>`_

.. code-block:: julia

    using FastGaussQuadrature
    x, w = gausslegendre( 100_000 ); # i.e. find 100,000 nodes

    # integrates f(x) = x^2 from -1 to 1
    f(x) = x^2
    @show w ⋅ f.(x); # calculate integral

The only problem with the ``FastGaussQuadrature`` package is that you will need to deal with affine transformations to the non-default domains yourself

Alternatively, ``QuantEcon.jl`` has routines for Gaussian quadrature that translate the domains

.. code-block:: julia

    using QuantEcon

    x, w = qnwlege(65, -2π, 2π);
    @show w ⋅ cos.(x); # i.e. on [-2π, 2π] domain

Expectations
---------------

If the calculations of the numerical integral is simply for calculating mathematical expectations of a particular distribution, then `Expectations.jl <https://github.com/QuantEcon/Expectations.jl>`_ provides a convenient interface

Under the hood, it is finding the appropriate Gaussian quadrature scheme for the distribution using ``FastGaussQuadrature``

.. code-block:: julia

    using Distributions, Expectations
    dist = Normal()
    E = expectation(dist)
    f(x) = x
    @show E(f) #i.e. identity

    # Or using as a linear operator
    f(x) = x^2
    x = nodes(E)
    w = weights(E)
    E * f.(x) == f.(x) ⋅ w


Interpolation
=============================

In economics we often wish to interpolate discrete data (i.e., build continuous functions that join discrete sequences of points)

The package we usually turn to for this purpose is `Interpolations.jl <https://github.com/JuliaMath/Interpolations.jl>`_

There are a variety of options, but we will only demonstrate the convenience notation

Univariate with a Regular Grid
--------------------------------

Let's start with the univariate case

We begin by creating some data points, using a sine function

.. code-block:: julia

    using Interpolations
    using Plots
    gr(fmt=:png);

    x = -7:7 # x points, coase grid
    y = sin.(x) # corresponding y points

    xf = -7:0.1:7        # fine grid
    plot(xf, sin.(xf), label = "sin function")
    scatter!(x, y, label = "sampled data", markersize = 4)


To implement linear and cubic spline interpolation


.. code-block:: julia

    li = LinearInterpolation(x, y)
    li_spline = CubicSplineInterpolation(x, y)

    @show li(0.3) # evaluate at a single point

    scatter(x, y, label = "sampled data", markersize = 4)
    plot!(xf, li.(xf), label = "linear")
    plot!(xf, li_spline.(xf), label = "spline")


Univariate with Irregular Grid
---------------------------------

In the above, the ``LinearInterpolation`` function uses a specialized function 
for regular grids since ``x`` is a ``Range`` type

For an arbitrary, irregular grid


.. code-block:: julia
    
    x = log.(range(1, exp(4), length = 10)) .+ 1  # uneven grid
    y = log.(x) # corresponding y points

    interp = LinearInterpolation(x, y)
    
    xf = log.(range(1,  exp(4), length = 100)) .+ 1 # finer grid

    plot(xf, interp.(xf), label = "linear")
    scatter!(x, y, label = "sampled data", markersize = 4, size = (800, 400))

At this point, ``Interpolations.jl`` does not have support for cubic splines with irregular grids, but there are plenty of other packages that do (e.g. `Dierckx.jl <https://github.com/kbarbary/Dierckx.jl>`_  and `GridInterpolations.jl <https://github.com/sisl/GridInterpolations.jl>`_)

Multivariate Interpolation
--------------------------------

Interpolating a regular multivariate function uses the same function

.. code-block:: julia

    f(x,y) = log(x+y)
    xs = 1:0.2:5
    ys = 2:0.1:5
    A = [f(x,y) for x in xs, y in ys]

    # linear interpolation
    interp_linear = LinearInterpolation((xs, ys), A)
    @show interp_linear(3, 2) # exactly log(3 + 2)
    @show interp_linear(3.1, 2.1) # approximately log(3.1 + 2.1)

    # cubic spline interpolation
    interp_cubic = CubicSplineInterpolation((xs, ys), A)
    @show interp_cubic(3, 2) # exactly log(3 + 2)
    @show interp_cubic(3.1, 2.1) # approximately log(3.1 + 2.1);

See `Interpolations.jl documentation <https://github.com/JuliaMath/Interpolations.jl#convenience-notation>`_ for more details on options and settings




.. -----------------------------
.. 
.. We can also interpolate in higher dimensions
.. 
.. The following example gives one illustration
.. 
.. .. code-block:: julia
.. 
..     let
..         n = 5
..         x = range(-3,  3, length = n)
..         y = copy(x)
.. 
..         z = zeros(n, n)
..         f(x, y) = cos(x^2 + y^2) / (1 + x^2 + y^2)
..         for i ∈ 1:n
..             for j ∈ 1:n
..                 z[j, i] = f(x[i], y[j])
..             end
..         end
.. 
..         itp = interpolate((x, y), z, Gridded(Linear()));
.. 
..         nf = 50
..         xf = range(-3,  3, length = nf)
..         yf = copy(xf)
.. 
..         zf = zeros(nf, nf)
..         ztrue = similar(zf)
..         for i ∈ 1:nf
..             for j ∈ 1:nf
..                 zf[j, i] = itp[xf[i], yf[j]]
..                 ztrue[j, i] = f(xf[i], yf[j])
..             end
..         end
.. 
..         grid = gridmake(x, y)
..         z = reshape(z, n * n, 1)
.. 
..         surface(xf, yf, zf', color = :greens, falpha = 0.7, cbar = false)
..         surface!(xf, yf, ztrue', fcolor = :blues, falpha = 0.25, cbar = false)
..         scatter!(grid[:, 1], grid[:, 2], vec(z), legend = :none, color = :black,
..                  markersize = 4)
..     end
.. 
.. The original function is in blue, while the linear interpolant is shown in green

Linear Algebra
==================

Standard Library
------------------

The standard library contains many useful routines for linear algebra, in
addition to standard functions such as ``det()``, ``inv()``, ``factorize()``, etc.

Routines are available for

* Cholesky factorization

* LU decomposition

* Singular value decomposition,

* Schur factorization, etc.

See `here <https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/LinearAlgebra/>`_ for further details


General Tools
=================================

LaTeXStrings.jl
------------------

When you need to properly escape latex code (e.g. for equation labels), use `LaTeXStrings.jl <https://github.com/stevengj/LaTeXStrings.jl>`_

.. code-block:: julia

    using LaTeXStrings
    L"an equation: $1 + \alpha^2$"

ProgressMeter.jl
------------------

For long-running operations, you can use the `ProgressMeter.jl <https://github.com/timholy/ProgressMeter.jl>`_ package

To use the package, you simply put a macro in front of ``for`` loops, etc.

From the documentation

.. code-block:: julia

    using ProgressMeter

    @showprogress 1 "Computing..." for i in 1:50
        sleep(0.1) # some computation....
    end
