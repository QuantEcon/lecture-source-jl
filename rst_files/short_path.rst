Overview
=============

The shortest path problem is a `classic problem <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path>`_ in mathematics and computer science with applications in

* Economics (sequential decision making, analysis of social networks, etc.)

* Operations research and transportation

* Robotics and artificial intelligence

* Telecommunication network design and routing

* etc., etc.

Variations of the methods we discuss in this lecture are used millions of times every day, in applications such as

* Google Maps

* routing packets on the internet

For us, the shortest path problem also provides a nice introduction to the logic of **dynamic programming**

Dynamic programming is an extremely powerful optimization technique that we apply in many lectures on this site

Outline of the Problem
=========================

The shortest path problem is one of finding how to traverse a `graph <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28mathematics%29>`_ from one specified node to another at minimum cost

Consider the following graph

.. figure:: /_static/figures/graph.png
   :scale: 100%

We wish to travel from node (vertex) A to node G at minimum cost

* Arrows (edges) indicate the movements we can take
* Numbers on edges indicate the cost of traveling that edge

Possible interpretations of the graph include

* Minimum cost for supplier to reach a destination
* Routing of packets on the internet (minimize time)
* Etc., etc.

For this simple graph, a quick scan of the edges shows that the optimal paths are

* A, C, F, G at cost 8

.. figure:: /_static/figures/graph4.png
   :scale: 100%

* A, D, F, G at cost 8

.. figure:: /_static/figures/graph3.png
   :scale: 100%

Finding Least-Cost Paths
===========================

For large graphs we need a systematic solution

Let :math:`J(v)` denote the minimum cost-to-go from node :math:`v`, understood as the total cost from :math:`v` if we take the best route

Suppose that we know :math:`J(v)` for each node :math:`v`, as shown below for the graph from the preceding example

.. figure:: /_static/figures/graph2.png
   :scale: 100%

Note that :math:`J(G) = 0`

The best path can now be found as follows

* Start at A

* From node v, move to any node that solves

.. math::
    :label: spprebell

    \min_{w \in F_v} \{ c(v, w) + J(w) \}

where

* :math:`F_v` is the set of nodes that can be reached from :math:`v` in one step

* :math:`c(v, w)` is the cost of traveling from :math:`v` to :math:`w`

Hence, if we know the function :math:`J`, then finding the best path is almost trivial

But how to find :math:`J`?

Some thought will convince you that, for every node :math:`v`,
the function :math:`J` satisfies

.. math::
    :label: spbell

    J(v) = \min_{w \in F_v} \{ c(v, w) + J(w) \}

This is known as the *Bellman equation*, after the mathematician Richard Bellman

Solving for :math:`J`
=========================

The standard algorithm for finding :math:`J` is to start with

.. math::
    :label: spguess

    J_0(v) = M \text{ if } v \not= \text{ destination, else } J_0(v) = 0

where :math:`M` is some large number

Now we use the following algorithm

#. Set :math:`n = 0`
#. Set :math:`J_{n+1} (v) = \min_{w \in F_v} \{ c(v, w) + J_n(w) \}` for all :math:`v`
#. If :math:`J_{n+1}` and :math:`J_n` are not equal then increment :math:`n`, go to 2

In general, this sequence converges to :math:`J`---the proof is omitted
